            <h2> Switch statement</h2>
            <p> 
                The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
                Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed
            </p>

            <h2> Looping constructs</h2>
            <div class="switch-example"> <p> I'm lost, this part needs to be reviewed</p></div>
            <h2> While loops </h2>
            <div class="loops">
                <div class="block-1">This is block 1</div>
                <div class="block-2">This is block 2</div>
                <div class="block-3">This is block 3</div>
            </div>
            <h2> For loops </h2>
            <p> The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run.
                It's a more concise way of writing a loop than the while loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                The for loop has the following syntax:
            </p>
            <p>
                for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                    code block to be executed
                }
            </p>
            <p> Here's an example of a for loop:</p>
            <div class="for-loop">
                <p> This is the first iteration</p>
                <p> This is the second iteration</p>
                <p> This is the third iteration</p>
                <p> This is the fourth iteration</p>
                <p> This is the fifth iteration</p>
            </div>
